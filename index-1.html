    <title>A Benchmark of Love</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>The tale of Radha and Krishna – A Benchmark of Love</h1>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from difficulties, we can also say that these problems are the exam of life, 
        which that divine spirit takes at certain intervals of life. Who gets through these exams becomes an 
        example and who fails have nothing except accusing the life? 
        The <strong>Bhagavad Gita, Ramayana, Mahabharata</strong> or other epic scriptures have a lot to teach you.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From mythological to this technological era, Radha Krishna has always been symbolised as a 
        benchmark of love. These two words in our Indian history are never been taken separately. 
        Whenever we talk about Radha, it is impossible for any human being to not to think about Lord Krishna. 
        It definitely strikes our head and compels us to think at least once about the everlasting tale of love.
        They shared an eternal love with each other. Regardless of the fact that they never tied a nuptial knot 
        together, they are worshipped together. These days, modern-day couples admire these pure souls most and 
        make promises to each other to be like them. They are the representation of the purest bond, love, 
        and emotions. It is their purity and serenity only which has made their love and care unforgettable.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several life lessons which young couples can learn from their story and implement it in 
        their life to make their bond of love stronger and better. From the mythological days of the universe, 
        Radha is known to be an avatar of Goddess Shakti and the most dedicated devotee of Lord Krishna. 
        Lord Krishna’s flute was enough to mesmerise her because she was madly in love with him.

    <h2>7 Vows of Love that Every Couple Should Inculcate in their Life</h2>
    <h4>1.&nbsp;<u>Two lovers should always stay with each other no matter what</u></h4>
    <p>This is an utmost important lesson which needs to be brought up in our everyday lives. Two lovers should never leave each other in any circumstance. If they are with you in your happiness, then they should stand by your side during the days when time is not in your favour. You both should be patient enough to calm down and wait for the good time.</p>
    <h4>2.&nbsp;<u>Do learn to wait</u></h4>
    <p>This vow teaches us the fact that patience is the key to success. It tells us the importance of waiting for your loved ones. If you feel that they are the right ones for you, then learn to wait. The journey of waiting isn’t always a bed of roses, sometimes it could be even worse than a road of thorns. But the fruit you get in the end is always worth it. And don’t get distracted by the lustrous stuff, which is usually there to divert you from your target. Wait till you meet your desired person.</p>
    <h4>3.&nbsp;<u>Stay focused on the very person you love</u></h4>
    <p>This is an extended version of the last one. It throws light on the truth that there are times when you need to stay away from your partner, but don’t be afraid of the distance. Distance plays a crucial role in a relationship. Although it is hard to stay away from your beloved, still no one can ever deny the thing that it is the only factor which teaches us the value of that concerned person and it brings us close to them. Respect the roleplay of destiny and have faith in The Almighty, he will bring things in your favour.</p>
    <h4>4.&nbsp;<u>Love the person with who they are as a person, not by what they look</u></h4>
    <p>Young couples should get this factor as the most important thing. We usually judge a person by their looks, although we know that appearances are deceptive. Krishna was as dark as a black cloud and Radha was heavenly, yet it didn’t affect their love even for a bit.</p>
    <h4>5.&nbsp;<u>If your beloved goes in a wrong path, make it your responsibility to bring them to the right path</u></h4>
    <p>Many times it happens to choose a wrong path when you are unable to take a right decision. At that time, they need you the most . They won’t tell you to be there, but they want you to. And it’s your responsibility to bring them to the right path. It’s the hardest time as they won’t listen to you but you need to convince them what’s good for them and what is not. You need to put your entire energy and willpower to make things happen.</p>
    <h4>6.&nbsp;<u>It is important to be aware of each- other’s true personality</u></h4>
    <p>You have to be aware of your beloved’s true identity. As a partner, it is your moral duty to motivate them to reach every height of life. But at the same time, make sure that you don’t drag them into a marshal of lies. Don’t overestimate their capabilities that they become over-confident and ultimately will harm your own relationship.</p>
    <h4>7.&nbsp;<u>Their troubles are yours and vice-versa</u></h4>
    <p>When you are part of their happiness, then why not be with them during their bad times ? You both love each other, and it is natural to share everything and be a part of every event of their life, may it be a celebration or a problem. You should treat their troubles equally as yours and find a solution accordingly.</p>

    <h2>The 10 Avatars of Lord Vishnu (Dashavatar & Yugas)</h2>
    <p>
        Hindus believe that when the earth is threatened by disorder or wickedness, Lord Vishnu would descend on it in one of his incarnations to restore justice.

        The reincarnations of Lord Vishnu are commonly referred to as Avatars. According to Hindu mythology, Vishnu has taken on ten different guises or avatars.
        
        The legend also states that the avatars began during the Satya Yuga, also called the Golden Era or Age of Truth, when gods ruled over humanity.
        
        The ten incarnations of Vishnu worshipped by Hindus are known together as Dashavatara. Dasha means ten in Sanskrit, and Avatara means incarnation.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>- <b>Satya yuga</b> was the first era, and it was at this time that the first four avatars manifested.</li>
        <li>- <b>Treta yuga</b> was the second yuga, and it included the appearance of three more avatars.</li>
        <li>- <b>Dawapara yuga</b>, the third, saw the appearance of two new avatars.</li>
        <li>- The next yuga, <b>Kali Yuga</b>, in which the final Avatar of Lord Vishnu, Kalki, will come.</li>
    </ul>
    <i>- The end of this yuga is predicted to occur in about another 432,000 years.</i>
    <br>
    <i>- A new yuga, appropriately named <b>Kalki yuga</b>, will begin after the evil and wicked forces on Earth are eradicated by the <b>Kalki avatar</b>, and the righteous are set free.</i>
