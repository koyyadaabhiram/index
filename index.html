    <h1>The tale of Radha and Krishna – A Benchmark of Love</h1>
    <p>
        From mythological to this technological era, Radha Krishna has always been symbolised as a 
        benchmark of love. These two words in our Indian history are never been taken separately. 
        Whenever we talk about Radha, it is impossible for any human being to not to think about Lord Krishna. 
        It definitely strikes our head and compels us to think at least once about the everlasting tale of love.
        They shared an eternal love with each other. Regardless of the fact that they never tied a nuptial knot 
        together, they are worshipped together. These days, modern-day couples admire these pure souls most and 
        make promises to each other to be like them. They are the representation of the purest bond, love, 
        and emotions. It is their purity and serenity only which has made their love and care unforgettable.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are several life lessons which young couples can learn from their story and implement it in 
        their life to make their bond of love stronger and better. From the mythological days of the universe, 
        Radha is known to be an avatar of Goddess Shakti and the most dedicated devotee of Lord Krishna. 
        Lord Krishna’s flute was enough to mesmerise her because she was madly in love with him.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radha Krishna together has not only taught us to love each other but also taught
            that with love it is necessary to have patience, power of sacrifice, and strength to support your love.
            It is you that can bring your love in front of the society. It is not easy to always keep that same 
            spirit of love for anyone.But the great devotee Radha has proved whatever the situation comes in the life;
            if you have a pure love spirit no one can demolish it. You are the one who creates that 
            feeling and you are the ones who can preserve it. Difficulties and problems are 
            part of your life as happiness is a part of your life.

        Talking about bonds, not many people know, but the special relationship between Draupadi and 
        Krishna is the reason we celebrate Raksha Bandhan. It is said that when Krishna had hurt his wrist, 
        Draupadi tore the corner of her sari and tied it to stop the bleeding from his wrist. Seeing this, 
        Krishna vowed to protect her. Later, during Draupadi’s cheerharan at the hands of the Kauravas in full 
        court, Draupadi prayed to Krishna to protect her honour.
    </p>
    <p>
        In return, Krishna increased the length of her sari such that it would never end even as Dushasana 
        pulled it apart. It is said that Draupadi trusted Krishna more than anyone else and they called 
        each other Sakhi and Sakha, meaning female friend and male friend, respectively. Draupadi’s father 
        Drupad initially wanted to marry his daughter to Krishna. However, Krishna referred Arjuna as a 
        prospective groom for her.

        Apart from difficulties, we can also say that these problems are the exam of life, 
        which that divine spirit takes at certain intervals of life. Who gets through these exams becomes an 
        example and who fails have nothing except accusing the life? 
        The <strong>Bhagavad Gita, Ramayana, Mahabharata</strong> or other epic scriptures have a lot to teach you.
